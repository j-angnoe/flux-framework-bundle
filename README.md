# Joshua's Flux Framework for Symfony

Depends on symfony 7.1, php 8.2+

Contains:
- Vue2SPA (vue-blocks apps with bridges to symfony controllers)
- Wrappers around HttpClient/Response (adds streamLines and streamJsonlines)
- Flux Chain / Shell.
- BackgroundPHP + simple event streams
- Vue-blocks utilities like DataBrowser

_layers/vue-harness has been vendored, this may change in the future.
